Consider changing the data structures in AST to records, using prefixes to avoid name clashes, in order to have getter functions for the fields.
This would avoid ad-hoc solutions, such as (\(TypeFam tnam _ _) -> tnam) in the TypeCheck module.

Note that, by Andrzej's will, I extended the parser to allow superfluous parentheses around variables in terms.
Consider removing this feature.
